## Project Motivation
In this project, I'm interested in using Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020 data to analyze these following questions:
1. What are the distribution of women in tech (in comparison to men) in regard to the age, education level, and undergraduate major?
2. What are the popular developers type of women and men? How did men’s and women’s answers compare?
2. What are the popular programming languanges used by women and women? How did men’s and women’s answers compare?
3. How does women and men salary differ between each other?
